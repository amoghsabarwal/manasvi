                <p>We've been through so much, but the one thing that stands strong is our love—it’s just as deep as ever. In the year I spent apart from you, I felt like an empty shell, constantly searching for something to make me feel whole. What you don’t know is that every single one of those 365+ days, I found comfort just by looking at your profile picture. Knowing you were out there, happy, made me feel okay. So I don’t think you can fully understand how I feel now that I finally have you again. It’s like standing at the top of the world, like I can do anything as long as you’re by my side. You make me feel complete in a way that has genuinely changed my life—I’m happier, lighter, and everything just feels right. Thank you for making my life better, for making things easier just by being you. I don’t even have the words to explain how much you mean to me. You’ve become one of the most important parts of my life, and I want to be the best version of myself for you. You deserve the world, and I promise to do everything I can to give it to you.No matter what hardships come our way, I know we’ll get through them together—because when it’s us, there’s nothing we can’t face. I love you so much, baby, and I promise to keep you happy, forever and always.</p>
